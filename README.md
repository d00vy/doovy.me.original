> This ~~is~~ was one of my first repositories, and one of my first HTML/CSS projects in a very very long time.

View the demo of this site at http://old.doovy.me

I built this site from scratch to get myself back into the flow of HTML/CSS, and get used to my development environment with Git, Atom, and Cmder.

As of now, these files are simply here for reference, though I may revisit at some point in order to clean up the code and add sufficient comments for anyone else that may want to use this as a type of template or example.
